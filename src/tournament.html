          Small summary of the tournament
        </h3>
        <p class="section-tourney__text">
          On monday the 19th of March the tournament started. 12 pilots were
          about to fly for the honorable title, Mr SwitchBitchCutSlut 2018! The
          tournament started good, matches were scheduled via the platoon chat,
          people where recording there matches and posted them on Youtube.
          Unfortunately some delay entered the tourney. Different timezones, not
          responding on messages....
        </p>
        <p class="section-tourney__text">
          The following days/weeks the tournament slowly progressed but the
          matches were fun. I must admit, looking at the bracket, the difference
          in scores were a bit to big to my opinion. To much matches ended like
          5-1 or 5-0. The match between Switchophrenia and imanium was fun to
          watch. Another match I liked to watch in spectator mode was between
          -END-M4XlMUS and iDF-Snickers. Intense fights!
        </p>
        <p class="section-tourney__text">
          Unfortunately a nasty incident occurred during a match between
          FlufyMarshmllows and Switchophrenia. We all know how that ended. I was
          very disapointed by the incident. I don't know how the other pilots
          felt, I mean, lets be honest, the game is old and not many people play
          anymore. The dogfight community isn't alive anymore the way it was,
          but still it was a nasty incident...
        </p>
        <p class="section-tourney__text">
          We ended the tourney on the 26th of Aril. So for a tourney with 12
          pilots it took a long time. FlufyMarshmllows, a well respected top BF3
          dogfighter and iDF-Snickers, also a well respected top BF4 dogfighter
          were in the final. They flew for the honorable title Mr
          SwitchBitchCutSlut 2018! The final took three days, about two hours
          per day. The fights were very long and intense. Both of them didn't
          want to loose. I could clearly see this in spectator mode.
          FlufyMarshmllows started the match very strong. He gained a lead by
          3-1. But iDF-Snickers crashed two times. iDF-Snickers got the upper
          hand in the match and won the final by 5-3! Very strong comeback! Both
          of them created a great final!
        </p>
        <h4 class="animated bounce section-tourney__winner">
          The winner of the tournament, Mr SwitchBitchCutSlut 2018,
          iDF-Snickers! Congratulations!
        </h4>
        <p class="section-tourney__text">
          Both of them have a Youtube channel. They will post the final on their
          channels.

          I streamed some of the final in spectator mode. The last part of the
          final has some good quality. At that time the score was 3-3.<a
