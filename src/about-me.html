        <p class="section-aboutme__text">
          I started this server when I noticed, that the dogfight server, Jin's
          Dogfight Jungle, was no longer online. I wanted to learn how to
          dogfight! I wanted to get better at it. I wanted to learn switches,
          scissors, cuts, speed control and more. I went to the following site,
          <a href="https://www.i3d.net/" target="_blank" class="btn"
            >and rented a server.</a
          >
          The end of November 2016 the server was online!

        <p class="section-aboutme__text">
          In the beginning, I started to dogfight against various pilots with
          different styles. They were giving me some tips regarding switching,
          timing, headons and cutting. I got a little better at dogfighting and
          the following months, I flew against several other pilots and improved
          a little.

          >. Haavke has been around for sometime in the dogfight community. He
          was also there, when iDF-Jin hosted his server Jin's Dogfight Jungle.
          BTW, I was also around but gave dogfighting up....Somehow Haavke and
          me got along and the following months we practiced a lot. We uploaded
          our fights to Youtube to whatch each others improvement/mistakes. I
          can only speak for my self but these sessions I improved a lot. To my
          opnion Haavke improved also! During our sessions a pilot called
          Dzendog showed up. A top pilot who started to practice whit us. He has
          an interresting style. He uses the BF4 cam and for what I know, most
          of the pilots use the BF3 cam. Dzendog is now retired. Haavke is the
          pilot I practice the most with. I don't know what level I am now, if
          there is any level nowadays, but I think I am slightly above average.

          Despite there is not much of a dogfight scene left anymore I still
          like to dogfight. It's kind of addictive xD. I see you in the skys!

          Unfortunatly some pilots caused some trouble on the server. Like
          shooting at pilots who are dogfighting or entering the server and
          instantly shooting with activs/passives to dogfighters. I know from my
          own experience that it can be very frustating sometimes. But that's
          part of the learning curve. It doesn't mean you have to be a noob and
          begin to rage vs other pilots. Take a beer/whiskey and calm down xD.

          From now on I will kick and ban everyone who is acting like a fool or
